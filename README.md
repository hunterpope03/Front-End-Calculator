This web-based calculator utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic, negative, and decimal operations and functions similarly to that of an Apple brand calculator. 

The HTML and CSS structure for this site is fairly simple. It features: 
  one outer div for the outer calculator box and six inner divs for each row
  grid layout for the rows 
  styled buttons for color and effects

The JavaScript for this site is slightly more intricate. I use the jQuery library to easily update the display and standard JavaScript for the code logic. 
Instead of simply allowing a user to type in a complex expression and evaluating it (with an eval() function), I opted to handle values and operators with separate variables. 
This allows for clean-flowing, automatic calculations similar to that of earlier versions of the Apple brand calculator. 
I have added comments for the JavaScript in the "script.js" file that explains how each function works.
